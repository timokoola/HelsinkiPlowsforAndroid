HelsinkiPlowsforAndroid
=======================

Helsinki Snowplows on Android. This app is built upon Helsinki stara Open API that can be used to fetch almost real-time information about snowplows in Helsinki area. See https://github.com/codeforeurope/aura/wiki/API for details of the API. 
Building
========

There are two dependencies:

Maps
----

- Google Play services Maps API, needed jar is included and app will build itself. For further tweaking see documentation at: 
http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/maps.html
- Maps require developer to register for a service key. I have placed mine in keys.xml with a key google_maps_key. That value is referenced in AndroidManifest.xml like this: 
    <meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY"
    android:value="@string/google_maps_key"/>
- Register your own key at Google Play services console
